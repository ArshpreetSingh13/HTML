                <hr>

                <hr>
                <p>shington:
                    The US Supreme Court has cleared Mumbai attack convict Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India,
                    dismissing his review petition against the move.

                    India is seeking the extradition of Rana, a Canadian national of Pakistani origin, as he is wanted
                    in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks case. This was Rana's last legal chance not to be extradited to
                    India. Earlier, he lost a legal battle in several federal courts, including the US Court of Appeals
                    for the North Circuit in San Francisco.

                    Rana on November 13 filed a "petition for a writ of certiorari" before the US Supreme Court. This
                    was denied by the top court on January 21, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the American
                    President.

                    "Petition DENIED," the Supreme Court said.

                <p>Windows 11 is getting colorful new battery icons that are easier to understand at a glance</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Microsoft is releasing a new Windows 11 Insider Preview Build today with some welcome improvements to
                    the operating system’s battery icon – possibly sparing you the realization that you’ve chosen a dead
                    outlet, or improperly plugged in your power adapter, or let your battery drain too much, before it’s
                    far too late.The new colored battery icons will appear on the taskbar’s system tray, in the quick settings flyout, and in the general Windows Settings. Microsoft says they’ll also eventually be used on the Lock screen, but that functionality is coming in a future build.

                <p>AI Search Optimization: Make Your Structured Data Accessible</p>
                <hr>
                <strong><p>by Matt G. Southern</p></strong>
                <hr>
                <p>A recent investigation has uncovered a problem for websites relying on JavaScript for structured data.

                    This data, often in JSON-LD format, is difficult for AI crawlers to access if not in the initial HTML response.
                    
                    Crawlers like GPTBot (used by ChatGPT), ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot can’t execute JavaScript and miss any structured data added later.
                    
                    This creates challenges for websites using tools like Google Tag Manager (GTM) to insert JSON-LD on the client side, as many AI crawlers can’t read dynamically generated content.
                    Key Findings About JSON-LD & AI Crawlers
                    Elie Berreby, the founder of SEM King, examined what happens when JSON-LD is added using Google Tag Manager (GTM) without server-side rendering (SSR).
                    
                    He found out why this type of structured data is often not seen by AI crawlers:
